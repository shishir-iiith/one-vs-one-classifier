We chose to build the RandomForest classifier using Decision Trees as the decision
functions for voting. The RandomForest classifier we built was made from scratch, as
required by the assignment regulations. 

We kept the ensemble classifier as simple as possible, given the small size of the data.

The classifier can be run by running the ‘SG-90_classifier.py’ command in the terminal 
opened from the same folder where the program and training data file lies. 
The user will be prompted to input the ‘test.csv file location’ after running the program,
and executing this will produce a ‘predictions.csv’ file containing the predicted labels. 
Although, the folder also contains the predicted labels after running the classifier.

We obtained an accuracy of 96.36% from our classifier on a test split of 20% of the
given training data.

Note:- The ‘penguins_train.csv’ and ‘test.csv’ file must be kept in the same folder as
the ‘SG-90_classifier.py’ for the classifier to run correctly.


This directory contains a classifier file named 'SG-90_classifier.py', a python notebook
named 'SG-90_extras.ipynb' containing the extras and the analysis. 
The plots can be found in the final report in 'SG-90_Report.pdf' as well as the notebook.

The original training and testing data is kept in the folder and is supposed to be kept
here with the classifier file to make it run correctly.

There is 'predictions.csv' as well which contains the predicted labels from
'penguins_test.csv'. However, the classifier file can be run and the 'predictions.csv'
can still be obtained.
